    "Recommendation": [
        "1. Check system logs using `dmesg` or `journalctl` for any hidden errors.",
        "2. Run a memory test using `memtest86+` to identify hardware issues.",
        "3. Verify system date and time settings if encountering certificate errors.",
        "4. Update the BIOS to the latest version if a ROM failure is suspected.",
        "5. Perform a full disk check using `fsck` to detect file system errors.",
        "6. Monitor system temperatures with tools like `lm-sensors` to check for overheating.",
        "7. Ensure all Windows updates are installed to resolve potential driver issues."
