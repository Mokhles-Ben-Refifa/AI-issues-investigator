{
    "Root Cause": "Blocked incoming connection on port 22",
    "Log Classification": "Network",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Blocked incoming connection from 203.0.113.5 on port 22",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Unauthorized access attempt on port 22 (SSH).",
            "Misconfigured firewall rules.",
            "Legitimate connection attempt being blocked by over-restrictive firewall policies."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The firewall blocked an incoming connection from IP address 203.0.113.5 on port 22, which is typically used for SSH access.",
            "Impact": "If this is a legitimate connection, the user cannot access the server via SSH. If malicious, it prevents potential unauthorized access.",
            "Correlations": "This could be linked to brute-force attacks, SSH port scanning, or configuration changes in the firewall."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is an unauthorized access attempt on port 22, which was correctly blocked by the firewall. However, if this is a legitimate connection, firewall rules may need adjustment."
