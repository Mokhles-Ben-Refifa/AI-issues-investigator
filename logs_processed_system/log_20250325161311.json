{
    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 09:13:00] ERROR - CPU usage exceeded 95% for 2 minutes",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive tasks or processes",
            "Inefficient application code",
            "Malware or unauthorized processes"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system detected high CPU usage sustained over 2 minutes, leading to a worker process restart.",
            "Impact": "Prolonged high CPU usage can cause system slowdowns, unresponsiveness, or service interruptions.",
            "Correlations": "The worker process was restarted, which may indicate a repeated issue if the underlying cause isn't addressed."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The high CPU usage is likely due to resource-intensive processes or inefficient code, requiring investigation into the system's workload and application performance."
    }
