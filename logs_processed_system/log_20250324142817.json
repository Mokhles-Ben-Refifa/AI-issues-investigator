    "Root Cause": "System boot issue possibly due to misconfiguration or hardware failure.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Linux version 5.15.0-58-generic started",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Kernel boot failure",
            "System misconfiguration",
            "Hardware failure"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log indicates the kernel starting, but the timestamp suggests a potential boot issue.",
            "Impact": "The system may fail to boot properly, affecting all services and applications.",
            "Correlations": "No other logs provided, but this could be linked to hardware or configuration issues."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The kernel start message suggests a boot issue, likely due to system misconfiguration or hardware failure."
