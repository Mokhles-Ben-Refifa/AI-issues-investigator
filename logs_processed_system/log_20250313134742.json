{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage caused by the 'database_service' process.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive database operations",
            "Inefficient database queries",
            "Malfunctioning database service"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Sustained high CPU usage leading to a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "Degraded system performance and eventual shutdown.",
            "Correlations": "Linked to high CPU usage warnings and critical system failure."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process is the primary cause of high CPU usage."
