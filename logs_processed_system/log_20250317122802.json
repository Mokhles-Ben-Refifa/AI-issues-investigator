{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage caused by the 'database_service' process leading to kernel panic and system shutdown.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive operations in the database service",
            "Inefficient database queries or indexing",
            "Malfunctioning or misconfigured database service",
            "Insufficient system resources for the workload"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system logs show a progression from high CPU usage warning (85%) to critical CPU usage by the database service (95%) and ultimately a kernel panic leading to shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The high CPU usage caused performance degradation, which escalated to a kernel panic, resulting in a system shutdown and potential data loss or corruption.",
            "Correlations": "The CPU usage warning and error logs directly correlate with the kernel panic, indicating that the system became unstable due to prolonged high CPU usage."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The high CPU usage by the database service is the root cause, as it led to system resource exhaustion and instability, culminating in a kernel panic and system shutdown."
