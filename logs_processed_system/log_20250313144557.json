{
    "Root Cause": "Kernel panic due to system resource exhaustion.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Kernel panic detected. System is shutting down.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Critical system resource exhaustion",
            "Hardware failure",
            "Driver issues",
            "Corrupted system files"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system experienced a kernel panic, a critical failure requiring an immediate shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The shutdown results in complete service unavailability and potential data loss if not properly handled.",
            "Correlations": "This issue follows prolonged high CPU usage and performance degradation, suggesting resource exhaustion as a trigger."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The kernel panic is most likely a result of prolonged high CPU usage and system instability, leading to a critical system failure."
