{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage due to the 'database_service' process.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "CPU usage has exceeded 85% for the last 5 minutes.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Increased workload or resource-intensive operations.",
            "Inefficient code or algorithms in the database service.",
            "Resource leaks or improper resource management."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system experienced sustained high CPU usage, peaking at 95% due to the 'database_service' process, leading to performance degradation and eventually a kernel panic.",
            "Impact": "High CPU usage caused performance degradation, which led to a critical system failure (kernel panic) and subsequent shutdown.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage correlated with the 'database_service' process, which was identified as the primary consumer of system resources."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The sustained high CPU usage, specifically from the 'database_service' process, is the root cause of the system instability and eventual shutdown."
    }
