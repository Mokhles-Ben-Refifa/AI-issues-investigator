{
    "Root Cause": "Web server crash detected, requiring service restart.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "2025-02-25 16:10:20 CRITICAL [System] Web server crash detected. Restarting service.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Repeated worker process restarts leading to system instability.",
            "Underlying system resource exhaustion (e.g., memory or CPU).",
            "Faulty restart mechanism or configuration."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system detected a critical failure of the web server, triggering a restart. This followed multiple worker process restarts due to connection limits being exceeded.",
            "Impact": "The web server became completely unavailable, requiring a full service restart, which can lead to prolonged downtime and failure to handle any incoming requests during the restart period.",
            "Correlations": "The crash occurred after multiple worker process restarts, suggesting that the repeated restarts may have contributed to system instability or resource depletion."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The root cause is the critical failure of the web server, likely due to repeated worker process restarts and resource exhaustion, leading to a system-wide restart of the service."
