{
    "Root Cause": "CPU temperature above threshold causing throttling",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "CPU1: Core temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High system load",
            "Poor cooling system",
            "Malfunctioning thermal sensor"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log shows a kernel-level warning about CPU temperature exceeding a threshold.",
            "Impact": "CPU throttling can lead to performance degradation and slower system response.",
            "Correlations": "This issue may be related to high system load or poor cooling system design."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The root cause is likely the high CPU temperature, which triggered the throttling mechanism."
    }
