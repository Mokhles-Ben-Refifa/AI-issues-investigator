{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage caused by the 'database_service' process leading to kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive operations in the database_service",
            "Memory leaks or inefficient memory usage",
            "Increased workload or traffic",
            "Suboptimal system configuration",
            "Buggy or faulty database_service implementation"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system initially showed high CPU usage (85%), which escalated to the database_service consuming 95% CPU. This led to a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The high CPU usage caused performance degradation, and the subsequent kernel panic resulted in a complete system shutdown, leading to downtime and potential data loss.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage warning and the critical kernel panic are directly correlated, as the system became unstable due to resource exhaustion."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is the excessive CPU consumption by the database_service process, which overwhelmed the system resources and led to a kernel panic."
