{
    "Root Cause": "Kernel panic caused by excessive CPU usage from the 'database_service' process.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "2025-03-13 10:20:05 CRITICAL [System] Kernel panic detected. System is shutting down.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High CPU usage leading to system instability.",
            "Faulty or malfunctioning hardware components.",
            "Driver issues causing kernel-level errors."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system experienced progressively increasing CPU usage, culminating in a kernel panic. The 'database_service' process was identified as consuming 95% CPU, indicating it as the primary contributor to the high usage.",
            "Impact": "The kernel panic resulted in a system shutdown, leading to downtime and potential data loss or corruption.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage from 'database_service' directly correlates with the subsequent kernel panic, as sustained high CPU usage can destabilize the system and trigger such critical failures."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The kernel panic was most likely triggered by the excessive CPU consumption of the 'database_service' process, which overwhelmed system resources and led to a critical failure."
