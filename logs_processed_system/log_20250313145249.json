{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive CPU consumption by the 'database_service' process leading to kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Inefficient database queries",
            "Lack of proper indexing in the database",
            "Increased traffic or load beyond system capacity",
            "Buggy or malfunctioning database service"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system logs show a progression from high CPU usage (85%) to a specific process ('database_service') consuming 95% CPU, culminating in a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The excessive CPU usage causes performance degradation, leading to a critical system failure and potential data loss or downtime.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage warning (85%) at 10:10:45, followed by the database_service error at 10:15:30, directly correlates with the kernel panic at 10:20:05, indicating a cascading system failure."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process consuming 95% CPU is the most likely root cause, as it directly leads to the observed performance degradation and subsequent system crash."
