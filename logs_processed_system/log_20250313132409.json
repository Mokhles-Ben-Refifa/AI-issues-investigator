{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage due to the 'database_service' process and subsequent kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Memory leak in the database service",
            "Inefficient database queries",
            "High load or resource-intensive operations",
            "Misconfiguration of the database service",
            "Underlying hardware or driver issues"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system initially reported high CPU usage (85%), followed by a critical error where the 'database_service' process consumed 95% CPU. This led to a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The high CPU usage degraded system performance, and the kernel panic resulted in a complete system shutdown, causing downtime and potential data loss.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage and kernel panic are directly correlated, as the extreme resource consumption likely triggered the kernel panic."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is the 'database_service' process consuming excessive CPU resources, potentially due to a memory leak or inefficient operations, which led to a kernel panic and system shutdown."
