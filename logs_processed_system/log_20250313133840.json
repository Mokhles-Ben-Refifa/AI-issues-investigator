{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage due to resource-intensive processes.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "2025-03-13 10:15:30 ERROR [System] Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive database queries",
            "Inefficient application code",
            "Malfunctioning or overloaded service"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system reported high CPU usage over a sustained period, leading to a kernel panic and shutdown. The process 'database_service' was identified as the primary CPU consumer.",
            "Impact": "High CPU usage caused performance degradation, leading to a critical system failure.",
            "Correlations": "The issue correlates with the warning about CPU usage exceeding 85% for 5 minutes, indicating a prolonged resource contention."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The high CPU usage is most likely due to the 'database_service' process consuming excessive resources, leading to system instability."
