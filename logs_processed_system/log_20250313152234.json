{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive CPU consumption by the 'database_service' process leading to kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Kernel panic detected. System is shutting down.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "A bug in the 'database_service' causing excessive CPU usage.",
            "Increased workload or stress on the system.",
            "Poor system configuration or lack of resource limits.",
            "Insufficient cooling or hardware failure."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The logs show a progression from high CPU usage warning (85%) to an error indicating the 'database_service' using 95% CPU, culminating in a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The system became unstable and shut down, leading to downtime and potential data loss or corruption.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage from 'database_service' directly correlates with the subsequent kernel panic, indicating resource exhaustion as the trigger."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process consumed excessive CPU resources, causing system instability and a kernel panic, which is the most likely root cause of the shutdown."
