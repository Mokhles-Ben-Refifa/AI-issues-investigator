{
    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage causing worker process restart.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 09:13:00] ERROR - CPU usage exceeded 95% for 2 minutes",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive application code",
            "Malfunctioning or stuck processes",
            "Inadequate system resources",
            "Poor load balancing"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system experienced sustained high CPU usage, triggering a worker process restart.",
            "Impact": "This could lead to service degradation, slow response times, or complete unavailability.",
            "Correlations": "The restart of the worker process indicates automatic recovery mechanisms were in place."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is high CPU usage overwhelming the system resources."
    }
