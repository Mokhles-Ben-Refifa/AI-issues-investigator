{
    "Root Cause": "CPU overload",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "CPU usage exceeded 90% for the last 5 minutes.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive process",
            "Inefficient algorithm",
            "Insufficient system resources"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The CPU usage has exceeded 90%, indicating a performance issue.",
            "Impact": "The system may become unresponsive or slow, affecting performance.",
            "Correlations": "Other logs may indicate slow responses or timeouts."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The CPU overload is the most likely root cause of the performance issue."
    }
