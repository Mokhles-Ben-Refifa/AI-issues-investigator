{
    "Root Cause": "CPU temperature above threshold, causing clock throttling",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "CPU1: Core temperature above threshold, cpu clock throttled",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Overheating CPU",
            "Inadequate cooling system",
            "Malfunctioning temperature sensor"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "High CPU temperatures can cause throttling, leading to performance degradation.",
            "Impact": "This issue can cause the system to slow down, leading to poor performance and potential crashes.",
            "Correlations": "This issue may be related to high system loads or inadequate cooling systems."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The log message directly indicates that the CPU temperature is above the threshold, causing clock throttling."
