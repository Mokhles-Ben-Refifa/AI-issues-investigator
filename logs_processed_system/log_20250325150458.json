{
    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage causing worker process restart.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 09:13:00] ERROR - CPU usage exceeded 95% for 2 minutes",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive tasks",
            "Inefficient code or loops",
            "Malware or unauthorized processes"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system experienced sustained high CPU usage, triggering a worker process restart.",
            "Impact": "Prolonged high CPU usage can lead to system slowdowns or crashes.",
            "Correlations": "The restart of the worker process suggests automatic resource management measures."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The high CPU usage is likely due to resource-intensive tasks or inefficient code."
    }
