{
    "Root Cause": "Kernel panic due to system instability caused by high CPU usage.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Kernel panic detected. System is shutting down.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Critical system resource exhaustion",
            "Driver or hardware failure",
            "Filesystem corruption",
            "Power failure"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Following the high CPU usage warning and error, the system experienced a kernel panic, leading to a shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The kernel panic resulted in an immediate system shutdown, causing downtime, potential data loss, and requiring a restart to resume operations.",
            "Correlations": "The kernel panic is directly linked to the preceding high CPU usage and system resource exhaustion caused by the 'database_service' process."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The kernel panic was triggered by system instability, most likely due to the high CPU usage from the 'database_service' process, making this the root cause of the critical issue."
