{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage due to the 'database_service' process causing system instability and kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "ERROR [System] Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "The 'database_service' process has a bug causing excessive CPU usage.",
            "The system's configuration is inadequate for the current workload.",
            "Increased workload overwhelming the 'database_service'."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Sustained high CPU usage by 'database_service' leading to kernel panic.",
            "Impact": "System performance degradation and eventual shutdown due to kernel panic.",
            "Correlations": "High CPU usage directly linked to 'database_service' and subsequent kernel panic."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process is the primary cause of high CPU usage and system instability."
