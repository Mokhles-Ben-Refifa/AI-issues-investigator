{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive CPU consumption by the 'database_service' process leading to a kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Bug in the database service causing excessive CPU usage",
            "Increased workload beyond system capacity",
            "Inefficient configuration leading to high resource consumption"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system experienced high CPU usage for an extended period, with the 'database_service' process spiking to 95% CPU, leading to a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "Resulted in system downtime, potential data loss, and service unavailability.",
            "Correlations": "High CPU usage warnings preceded the critical failure, indicating escalating resource strain."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process's excessive CPU usage was the primary cause of the system crash, as it overwhelmed system resources and triggered a kernel panic."
