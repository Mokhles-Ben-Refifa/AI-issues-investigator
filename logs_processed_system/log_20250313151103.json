{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage caused by the 'database_service' process leading to kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive operations in the database service",
            "Misconfiguration of the database service",
            "Increased workload beyond system capacity",
            "Lack of proper resource limits for the process"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system initially showed high CPU usage (85%), which escalated to a critical state where the 'database_service' process consumed 95% CPU. This led to a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The high CPU usage caused performance degradation, and the subsequent kernel panic resulted in a complete system shutdown, leading to downtime and potential data loss.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage warning preceded the critical error, indicating a progressive issue. The kernel panic suggests a severe system-level failure likely triggered by the overwhelming CPU consumption."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process consuming 95% CPU is the root cause, as it directly led to performance degradation and the eventual system crash."
