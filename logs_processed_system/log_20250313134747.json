    "Root Cause": "Memory exhaustion due to high RAM usage.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Out of memory. Killing process 'web_server'.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Memory leaks in applications",
            "Increased workload",
            "Inadequate memory allocation"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Memory usage exceeded 90%, leading to process termination and system unresponsiveness.",
            "Impact": "System instability and termination of critical processes.",
