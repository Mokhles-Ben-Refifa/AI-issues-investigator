{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage caused by the database_service process leading to system instability and kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "2025-03-13 10:15:30 ERROR [System] Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Memory leak in the database_service process",
            "Unusually high request volume without proper scaling",
            "Incorrect configuration of CPU throttling for the database_service"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system logs show increasing CPU usage over time, specifically from the database_service process, leading to a kernel panic.",
            "Impact": "The system became unresponsive, leading to a shutdown, affecting all services and users.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage directly correlates with the kernel panic, indicating the database_service as the primary cause."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The database_service's excessive CPU consumption is the root cause of system instability and crash."
