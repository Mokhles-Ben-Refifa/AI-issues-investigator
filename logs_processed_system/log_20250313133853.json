{
    "Root Cause": "Insufficient memory leading to process termination.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "2025-03-13 10:40:10 ERROR [System] Out of memory. Killing process 'web_server'.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Memory leaks in applications",
            "Increased memory demand from services",
            "Inadequate system memory allocation"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system memory reached critical levels, prompting the termination of the 'web_server' process. This followed warnings about high RAM usage.",
            "Impact": "Memory exhaustion caused the system to become unresponsive and terminate critical services.",
            "Correlations": "The issue aligns with the warning about RAM usage exceeding 90%, indicating a memory capacity problem."
        },
        "Conclusion": "Insufficient memory due to high usage led to the termination of the 'web_server' process, severely impacting system functionality."
