{
    "Root Cause": "Web server crash due to excessive connection overload.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Web server crash detected. Restarting service.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Critical system resource depletion.",
            "Underlying server misconfiguration.",
            "Failure in handling high load scenarios."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system initiated a restart after the web server crashed, indicating a critical failure.",
            "Impact": "Complete service unavailability until the restart completes.",
            "Correlations": "The crash is a direct consequence of the server exceeding its connection limit, as indicated by preceding logs."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The crash is a result of the server being unable to handle the excessive number of connections, leading to a critical system failure."
