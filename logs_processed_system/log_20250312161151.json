    "Root Cause": "Web server crash due to overwhelming connection requests.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Web server crash detected. Restarting service.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Critical system resource exhaustion",
            "Underlying server hardware failure",
            "Software bug causing instability",
            "Configuration error leading to service crash"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system initiated a restart after detecting the web server crash, indicating a critical failure.",
            "Impact": "Complete service outage, potential data loss, prolonged downtime during restart.",
            "Correlations": "Crash occurred after Nginx worker process exceeded connection limits."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The web server crash was most likely caused by the overwhelming number of connections leading to resource exhaustion."
