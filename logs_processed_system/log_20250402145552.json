{
    "Cluster ID": 2,
    "Root Cause": "Out of memory error causing process termination",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-01-01 11:00:00] ERROR - Out of memory: Kill process 1234 (myapp)",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Memory leak in the application",
            "Insufficient physical memory",
            "High memory usage by other processes"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system is experiencing out-of-memory issues, leading to process termination, permission issues, and service startup failures.",
            "Impact": "Critical system processes are being terminated, leading to service unavailability and potential system instability.",
            "Correlations": "The out-of-memory error is likely causing the subsequent permission and service startup issues."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The out-of-memory error is the root cause, likely due to a memory leak or insufficient physical memory, leading to cascading system failures."
    }
