{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage due to 'database_service' process causing kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Kernel panic detected. System is shutting down.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Excessive CPU usage by 'database_service' process.",
            "Inadequate system resources to handle the load.",
            "Potential bug or infinite loop in the database service."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system experienced progressively worsening CPU usage, starting with a warning at 85%, escalating to 95% usage by the database service, and culminating in a kernel panic.",
            "Impact": "The system became unstable, leading to a shutdown and potential data loss or service interruption.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage from the database service directly correlates with the kernel panic, indicating that the system could not sustain operations under such load."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The kernel panic was triggered by the 'database_service' consuming 95% CPU, overwhelming system resources and causing a critical failure."
