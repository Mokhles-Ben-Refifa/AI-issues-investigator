{
    "Cluster ID": 0,
    "Root Cause": "Memory exhaustion due to out-of-memory error",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-01-01 11:00:00] ERROR - Out of memory: Kill process 1234 (myapp)",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Memory leak in the application",
            "Excessive memory allocation",
            "High system load leading to memory depletion"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The logs indicate increasing memory usage leading to an out-of-memory error, which caused the system to terminate a process.",
            "Impact": "This issue causes instability and potential downtime as processes are terminated unexpectedly.",
            "Correlations": "The warning about a slow query might indicate increased memory usage over time."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The out-of-memory error is the most critical issue, directly pointing to memory exhaustion, likely due to a memory leak or excessive allocation."
