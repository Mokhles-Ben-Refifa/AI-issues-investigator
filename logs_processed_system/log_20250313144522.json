{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive CPU usage due to a malfunctioning 'database_service' process leading to a kernel panic.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Malfunctioning or buggy 'database_service' process",
            "Increased workload or improper resource allocation",
            "Configuration issues with the database service",
            "System resource starvation due to high CPU usage"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The logs show a progression from high CPU usage (85%) to a critical process consuming 95% CPU, followed by a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "The excessive CPU usage by the 'database_service' process caused system-wide performance degradation, eventually leading to a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage warning (85%) and the subsequent critical error (95% CPU by 'database_service') are directly correlated with the kernel panic event."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process is identified as the primary cause of the system failure due to its excessive CPU consumption, which overwhelmed the system resources and triggered a kernel panic."
