{
    "Root Cause": "Web server crash due to overwhelming connection load.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Web server crash detected. Restarting service.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Critical failure of server components due to overload.",
            "Underlying system resource exhaustion (CPU, memory).",
            "Corruption of server state requiring a restart."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system crash occurred immediately after the Nginx worker process crash, indicating a critical failure in maintaining service availability.",
            "Impact": "Complete service unavailability until the server restarts, affecting all users.",
            "Correlations": "The crash is directly linked to the preceding Nginx worker process failure, suggesting a cascade of failures due to the initial connection overload."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The system crash is a direct result of the server being overwhelmed by too many connections, leading to a critical failure requiring a restart."
