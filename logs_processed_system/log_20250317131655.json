{
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage due to the 'database_service' process.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource-intensive database queries or operations.",
            "Inefficient database indexing or locking mechanisms.",
            "Malfunctioning or misconfigured database service.",
            "Increased workload or traffic overwhelming the system."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system logs show a progression from high CPU usage (85%) to a critical state where the 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, leading to a kernel panic and system shutdown.",
            "Impact": "This issue causes significant performance degradation, leading to a complete system shutdown, which results in downtime and potential data loss or corruption.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage correlates directly with the 'database_service' process, indicating that this process is the primary contributor to the system's instability."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process is the root cause of the high CPU usage, which escalates to a kernel panic and system shutdown. This is the most likely root cause because it directly correlates with the observed CPU usage patterns and system failure."
