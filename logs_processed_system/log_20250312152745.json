{
    "Root Cause": "Web server crash due to overload from excessive connections.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Web server crash detected. Restarting service.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Overload from high request volume",
            "Inadequate server resources",
            "Poor load distribution",
            "Configuration issues"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The system restarted the service after detecting a crash, indicating a critical failure in maintaining operations under load.",
            "Impact": "Complete unavailability of the web service, impacting all users and dependent systems.",
            "Correlations": "The crash followed repeated worker process restarts, suggesting systemic overload beyond recovery capabilities."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The crash was due to sustained overload from excessive connections, overwhelming server capacity and leading to a critical failure."
