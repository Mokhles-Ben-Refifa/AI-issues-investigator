{
    "Root Cause": "Web server crash detected.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "2025-02-25 16:10:20 CRITICAL [System] Web server crash detected. Restarting service.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Resource exhaustion (e.g., CPU, memory).",
            "Unstable software or configuration leading to a crash.",
            "Corruption in system files or dependencies."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The crash occurred after the worker process exceeded its connection limit and was restarted, suggesting that the crash was a result of the server being overloaded.",
            "Impact": "The system becomes unavailable, leading to downtime and potential data loss or corruption.",
            "Correlations": "The crash is directly linked to the preceding server issues, indicating a cascading failure due to high load."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is that the web server crashed due to the overload from excessive connections and the subsequent failure of the worker process."
