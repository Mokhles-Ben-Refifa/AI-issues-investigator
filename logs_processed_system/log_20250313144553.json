{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive CPU usage by the 'database_service' process.",
    "Log Classification": "System",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Process 'database_service' is consuming 95% CPU, causing performance degradation.",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "A malfunction in the 'database_service' process",
            "Inadequate system resources for the workload",
            "Poor process optimization",
            "Unexpected increase in request volume"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The 'database_service' process is consistently using 95% CPU, indicating a resource bottleneck.",
            "Impact": "High CPU usage is causing system-wide performance degradation, affecting user experience and potentially leading to service unavailability.",
            "Correlations": "The high CPU usage correlates with the preceding warning about overall CPU usage exceeding 85% for 5 minutes."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The 'database_service' process is the primary cause of the high CPU usage, leading to performance issues."
