                "Log Message": "500 Internal Server Error - /api/data",
                "Possible Causes": [
                    "Missing configuration file leading to application crashes",
                    "Unhandled exceptions in the application code",

                "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
                    "Observations": "The server started successfully but encountered a 500 error when handling a request. A prior log indicates a missing 'config.yaml' file, which could be critical for the application's operation.",
                    "Impact": "Users are unable to access the /api/data endpoint, leading to potential data retrieval issues and application instability.",
                    "Correlations": "The 500 error correlates with the earlier 'FileNotFoundError' for 'config.yaml', suggesting a dependency on this file for proper functionality."
                },
                "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is the missing 'config.yaml' file, which is essential for the server to handle requests correctly. Without it, the application cannot process requests, resulting in a 500 error."

                    "Correlations": "This error is correlated with the subsequent 500 Internal Server Error, as the missing configuration likely caused the server to fail when handling requests."
