            "Root Cause": "Out of memory error causing process termination",
            "Log Classification": "System",
            "Explanation": {
                "Log Message": "[2025-01-01 11:00:00] ERROR - Out of memory: Kill process 1234 (myapp)",
                "Possible Causes": [
                    "High memory usage by the application",
                    "Memory leak in the application",
                    "Insufficient physical memory available"
                ],
                "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
                    "Observations": "The system ran out of memory, leading to process termination. This is a critical issue as it indicates the application is not handling memory properly.",
                    "Impact": "The process was terminated, which could lead to service unavailability and data loss.",
                    "Correlations": "The error occurred after a period of high memory usage as indicated by the WARNING log about query execution time."
                },
                "Conclusion": "The out-of-memory error is the most critical issue in this cluster, directly pointing to a system-level problem with memory management."
