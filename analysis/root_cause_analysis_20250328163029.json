                "Log Message": "[2025-03-28 15:45:01] ERROR - 500 Internal Server Error on /api/data",
                "Possible Causes": [
                    "Worker process crash due to high load",
                    "Misconfiguration in NGINX",

                "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
                    "Observations": "The logs indicate a 500 Internal Server Error, which suggests a server-side issue. The worker process exited unexpectedly, leading to a restart of the NGINX service.",
                    "Impact": "Users would experience service interruptions, and the system's reliability could be compromised.",
                    "Correlations": "The 500 error and worker process exit are directly correlated, indicating a server failure."

                "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is a worker process crash leading to a 500 Internal Server Error, which is a server-side issue."
