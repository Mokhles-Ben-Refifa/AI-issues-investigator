                "Log Message": "[2025-03-28 15:45:01] ERROR - 500 Internal Server Error on /api/data",
                "Possible Causes": [
                    "Worker process crash due to unhandled exception",
                    "High server load causing process termination",

                "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
                    "Observations": "The logs indicate a 500 Internal Server Error, followed by an unexpected worker process exit, and subsequent NGINX restart.",
                    "Impact": "Users would experience server errors (500), indicating the server is unable to handle requests.",
                    "Correlations": "The 500 error and worker process exit are directly correlated, suggesting the process crash led to the server error."
                },
                "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is a worker process crash, leading to a 500 Internal Server Error. The NGINX restart suggests an attempt to recover from this failure."
