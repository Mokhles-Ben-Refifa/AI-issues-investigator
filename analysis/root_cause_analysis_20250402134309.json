                "Log Message": "[2025-03-28 15:45:01] ERROR - 500 Internal Server Error on /api/data",
                "Possible Causes": [
                    "High server load",
                    "Memory exhaustion",
                    "Misconfigured server settings",
                    "Resource starvation"

                "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
                    "Observations": "The logs indicate a 500 Internal Server Error, which is a generic error indicating a problem with the server. The worker process exiting unexpectedly suggests a potential crash or overload.",
                    "Impact": "Users are unable to access the /api/data endpoint, leading to potential service disruption.",
                    "Correlations": "The restart of the NGINX service suggests an attempt to recover from the error, but the root cause may still persist."
                },
                "Conclusion": "The combination of the 500 error and worker process exit points to a server-side issue, likely due to overload or resource exhaustion."
