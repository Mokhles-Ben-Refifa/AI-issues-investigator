            "Root Cause": "Out of memory error leading to process termination",
            "Log Classification": "System",
            "Explanation": {
                "Log Message": "[2025-01-01 11:00:00] ERROR - Out of memory: Kill process 1234 (myapp)",
                "Possible Causes": [
                    "Memory leak in the application",
                    "High memory usage by other processes",
                    "Insufficient memory allocation for the process"
                ],
                "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
                    "Observations": "The system ran out of memory, causing process 1234 to be terminated. This indicates a critical resource exhaustion issue.",
                    "Impact": "The termination of process 1234 could lead to service unavailability or data loss.",
                    "Correlations": "The WARNING log about a slow query (4500ms) might be related to increased memory usage."
                },
                "Conclusion": "The out-of-memory error is the most critical issue as it directly caused process termination, indicating a potential memory management problem in the system."
