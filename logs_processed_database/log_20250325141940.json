    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "Database query timeout leading to a failed data retrieval attempt.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 10:15:50] ERROR - Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow-running database query",
            "High database load or contention",
            "Network latency or connectivity issues"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The logs indicate a TimeoutException during data retrieval, followed by a successful reconnection attempt.",
            "Impact": "This would result in failed user requests and potential service unavailability.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time warning (1200ms) precedes the timeout error, suggesting a performance degradation leading to the failure."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The timeout is the most probable root cause, likely due to a slow-running query or high database load."
