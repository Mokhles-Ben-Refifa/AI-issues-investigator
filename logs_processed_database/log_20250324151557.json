{
    "Root Cause": "Database connection timeout due to temporary unavailability or high latency.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Network connectivity issues",
            "Database server overload",
            "Firewall or security group restrictions",
            "Database replication lag"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The application experienced a timeout exception when attempting to retrieve data, followed by a successful reconnection attempt.",
            "Impact": "This issue would cause failures in data retrieval, leading to application errors and potential user-facing issues.",
            "Correlations": "The successful reconnection after the timeout suggests that the database server was temporarily unavailable or experiencing high latency."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is a temporary database connection issue, such as high server load or network latency, leading to a timeout exception."
