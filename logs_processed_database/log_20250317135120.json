    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Deadlock detected on table 'appointments'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Concurrent transactions accessing the same table",
            "Poor transaction isolation levels",

        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "A deadlock occurred on the 'appointments' table, indicating concurrent transactions conflicting over shared resources.",
            "Impact": "This can cause application crashes or data inconsistency, leading to failed operations and user frustration.",
            "Correlations": "The deadlock may be linked to the preceding transaction operations on the 'orders' table, suggesting a pattern of resource contention."
        },
