    "Root Cause": "Slow database queries leading to timeouts.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Temps de réponse élevé pour la requête utilisateur (1200ms)",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow database queries",
            "High database load",
            "Network latency"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "High response time observed before a TimeoutException occurred.",
            "Impact": "Users experience delays or errors in query processing.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time and subsequent timeout suggest a database performance issue."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The high response time and timeout are likely due to slow database queries."
