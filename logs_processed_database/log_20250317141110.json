    "Root Cause": "Deadlock on table 'appointments'",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Deadlock detected on table 'appointments'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Conflicting transactions accessing the same table",
            "Unindexed tables causing slow queries",
            "Poor transaction isolation levels",
            "Long-running transactions"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "A deadlock was detected on the 'appointments' table, indicating that two or more transactions were blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource.",
            "Impact": "This issue would cause delays in processing transactions and could lead to failed queries, impacting application functionality and user experience.",
            "Correlations": "The deadlock occurred shortly after a SELECT query on the 'patients' table and an UPDATE query on the 'orders' table, suggesting potential resource contention between concurrent transactions."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The deadlock is most likely caused by conflicting transactions accessing the 'appointments' table, possibly due to poor transaction design or resource contention."
