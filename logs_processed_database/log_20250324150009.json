{
    "Root Cause": "Slow database query causing a timeout.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow query execution",
            "High database load",
            "Network latency",
            "Database connection issues",
            "Locking or deadlocks"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log shows a high response time warning (1200ms) followed by a TimeoutException when retrieving data. The application successfully reconnected after the timeout, indicating the issue was temporary.",
            "Impact": "This issue causes delays in processing user requests, leading to a poor user experience and potential application unavailability.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time warning directly precedes the timeout error, suggesting a direct relationship between the slow query and the subsequent timeout."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is a slow database query that exceeded the timeout threshold, causing the application to fail retrieving data."
