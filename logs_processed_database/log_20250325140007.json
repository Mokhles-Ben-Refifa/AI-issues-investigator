{
    "Cluster ID": 0,
    "Root Cause": "Database timeout due to slow query or high load",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 10:15:50] ERROR - Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow-running database query",
            "High database load or contention",
            "Network latency between application and database"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The logs indicate a timeout exception when attempting to retrieve data from the database, followed by a successful reconnection attempt.",
            "Impact": "This issue could lead to failed user requests and potential application downtime.",
            "Correlations": "The WARNING log about elevated response times (1200ms) may be related to the subsequent timeout."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The timeout exception suggests that the database query exceeded the expected execution time, likely due to a slow query or high load. The successful reconnection indicates the database became available again, but the root cause of the timeout needs to be investigated."
