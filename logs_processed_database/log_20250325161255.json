        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 09:12:10] ERROR - Failed to connect to database: Timeout expired",

            "Observations": "The logs indicate a timeout when attempting to connect to the database, followed by a successful reconnection after a retry.",
            "Impact": "This could result in temporary unavailability of services relying on the database connection.",
            "Correlations": "The retry mechanism succeeded, but repeated timeouts may indicate an ongoing issue."
