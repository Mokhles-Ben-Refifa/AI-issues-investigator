{
    "Root Cause": "Database connection timeout due to high response time for user query.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow database query execution",
            "High database load or contention",
            "Network latency or connectivity issues",
            "Insufficient database connection pool size"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log shows a timeout exception when attempting to retrieve data, preceded by a warning about a high response time (1200ms) for a user query.",
            "Impact": "This issue would cause delays in processing user requests and could lead to application failures or user timeouts.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time warning and subsequent timeout exception are directly correlated, indicating a database-level issue affecting query performance."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The timeout exception is most likely due to the database being unable to respond within the expected timeframe, possibly due to slow queries or high load."
    }
