{
    "Root Cause": "Slow database query leading to a TimeoutException.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow query execution",
            "High database load",
            "Network latency",
            "Connection issues"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "A high response time warning preceded the timeout, indicating a potential slow query or overload.",
            "Impact": "The application failed to retrieve data, affecting user requests and system reliability.",
            "Correlations": "The timeout occurred after a high response time warning, suggesting query performance issues."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The TimeoutException was most likely due to a slow database query causing the operation to exceed the timeout threshold."
    }
