    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Deadlock detected on table 'appointments'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Long-running transactions holding locks",

        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "A deadlock occurred on the 'appointments' table during database operations. The log shows a query on 'patients' and an update on 'orders', which might be related to the 'appointments' table.",

            "Correlations": "The deadlock might be linked to other transactions accessing the 'appointments' table, possibly due to conflicting locks from multiple sessions."
        },
