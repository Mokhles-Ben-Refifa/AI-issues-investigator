    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "Database query timeout leading to a reconnection attempt.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 10:15:50] ERROR - Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow database query",
            "High database load",
            "Network latency"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "A TimeoutException occurred while attempting to retrieve data from the database, prompting a reconnection attempt.",
            "Impact": "Users may experience delayed responses due to the temporary loss of database connectivity.",
            "Correlations": "The timeout occurred after a warning about high response times, suggesting a potential underlying performance issue."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is a database query timeout, possibly due to a slow query or high load, which triggered the reconnection mechanism."
    }
