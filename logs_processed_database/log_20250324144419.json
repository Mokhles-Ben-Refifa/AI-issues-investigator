{
    "Root Cause": "Slow database query leading to a TimeoutException.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow database query",
            "High database load",
            "Network latency",
            "Database connection issues"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "A high response time warning (1200ms) was logged before the TimeoutException, indicating a potential database performance issue.",
            "Impact": "The application was unable to retrieve data within the expected timeframe, leading to a failure in processing the user request.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time warning and the subsequent TimeoutException are directly correlated, suggesting a database-related issue."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The TimeoutException is most likely due to a slow database query that exceeded the application's timeout threshold."
    }
