{
    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "Database query timeout",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 10:15:50] ERROR - Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Database query taking too long",
            "Network latency or connectivity issues",
            "High server load causing delays"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The application experienced a timeout while trying to retrieve data from the database. This could indicate a slow-running query or underlying database performance issues.",
            "Impact": "This would result in delayed or failed responses to user queries, potentially leading to a poor user experience.",
            "Correlations": "The timeout occurred after a warning about high response times, suggesting a pattern of increasing delays in query handling."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The timeout exception points directly to a database query that exceeded the expected execution time, making a database performance issue the most likely root cause."
    }
