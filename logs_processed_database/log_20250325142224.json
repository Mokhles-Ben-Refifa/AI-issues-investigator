    "Cluster ID": 0,
    "Root Cause": "Database timeout due to slow query execution.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 10:15:50] ERROR - Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow-running database query",
            "High database load or contention",
            "Network latency between application and database"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The application encountered a TimeoutException while attempting to retrieve data from the database. This occurred after a high response time warning (1200ms) was logged.",
            "Impact": "Users may experience delays or failures when fetching data. The system attempted to reconnect successfully, but the root cause of the timeout remains.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time warning (1200ms) preceding the timeout suggests a potential correlation between slow query execution and the eventual timeout."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most probable root cause is a slow-running database query that exceeded the timeout threshold, leading to the TimeoutException. This aligns with the observed high response time and subsequent reconnection attempt."
