{
    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "Database timeout during data retrieval.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 10:15:50] ERROR - Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow database query",
            "High database load",
            "Network latency",
            "Connection pool exhaustion"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The application encountered a TimeoutException while attempting to retrieve data from the database. This was preceded by a warning about high response times for a user query (1200ms).",
            "Impact": "This issue would result in failed user requests, potential application crashes, and a poor user experience due to delays or errors in data retrieval.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time warning (1200ms) correlates with the subsequent timeout error, indicating a possible performance degradation leading up to the failure."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is a database timeout due to a slow-running query or high load, which caused the application to fail in retrieving data within the expected timeframe."
