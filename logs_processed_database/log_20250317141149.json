{
    "Root Cause": "Database deadlock caused by concurrent transactions.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Deadlock detected on table 'appointments'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Concurrent transactions accessing the same table",
            "Inadequate locking mechanisms",
            "Poor transaction management"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log shows a deadlock on the 'appointments' table following a query and transaction.",
            "Impact": "This can cause application crashes or freezes, leading to service interruptions.",
            "Correlations": "Linked to the query and transaction logs around the same time."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The deadlock is likely due to concurrent transactions not being managed properly."
    }
