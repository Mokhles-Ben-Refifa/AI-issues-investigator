{
    "Root Cause": "Deadlock caused by concurrent transactions accessing the 'appointments' table.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Deadlock detected on table 'appointments'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Concurrent transactions accessing the same table",
            "Unindexed queries leading to locking",
            "Inadequate transaction isolation levels"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "A deadlock occurred between a SELECT query and an UPDATE transaction on the 'appointments' table, indicating concurrent access patterns leading to resource contention.",
            "Impact": "Transactions may be rolled back, causing application functionality issues and potential data inconsistency.",
            "Correlations": "The deadlock occurred after a SELECT query and before a COMMIT, suggesting conflicting locks between transactions."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The deadlock is most likely due to concurrent transactions accessing the 'appointments' table without proper locking mechanisms or isolation levels."
