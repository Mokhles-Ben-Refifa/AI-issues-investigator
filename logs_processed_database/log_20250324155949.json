{
    "Root Cause": "Slow database queries leading to timeout.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow database queries",
            "High database load",
            "Connection pool exhaustion",
            "Network latency"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log shows a TimeoutException during data retrieval, preceded by a high response time warning. The application successfully reconnected after the failure.",
            "Impact": "Users experience delays or failures in receiving responses, affecting application performance and user satisfaction.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time warning (1200ms) correlates with the subsequent timeout, indicating a persistent database performance issue."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is slow database queries causing the application to exceed the timeout threshold."
    }
