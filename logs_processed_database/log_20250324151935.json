{
    "Root Cause": "Database timeout due to high response time.",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow database queries",
            "High database load",
            "Network latency",
            "Temporary database unavailability"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log shows a TimeoutException during data retrieval, preceded by a high response time warning (1200ms). The application successfully reconnected after the timeout.",
            "Impact": "This issue caused a failure in retrieving data, affecting user request processing and leading to a temporary unavailability of the application's functionality.",
            "Correlations": "The high response time warning (1200ms) and the subsequent TimeoutException are directly correlated, indicating a database-level issue affecting query execution."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is a database issue causing a timeout, leading to the application's inability to retrieve data in a timely manner."
