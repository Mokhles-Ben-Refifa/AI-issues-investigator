    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "Database timeout leading to data retrieval failure",
    "Log Classification": "Database",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Échec de récupération des données : TimeoutException",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Slow database query",
            "High database load",
            "Network latency"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The logs indicate a TimeoutException during data retrieval, followed by a successful reconnection attempt.",
            "Impact": "This issue would cause delayed or failed responses to user requests.",
            "Correlations": "The WARNING log about elevated response times (1200ms) correlates with the subsequent timeout."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The timeout during data retrieval is most likely due to a database issue, possibly a slow query or high load, leading to the observed failure."
    }
