        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Sudden traffic spike",

        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "High request rate (1200 requests in 10 seconds) leading to connection exhaustion.",
            "Impact": "Service unavailable (503 errors), worker restarts, potential downtime.",
