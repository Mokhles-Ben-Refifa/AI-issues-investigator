{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive open connections exceeding the maximum limit (1024).",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic spike overwhelming server capacity.",
            "Misconfiguration of Nginx connection limits.",
            "Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Rapid increase in requests (1200 in 10 seconds) leading to connection exhaustion.",
            "Impact": "Users receive 503 Service Unavailable errors, and the server becomes unresponsive.",
            "Correlations": "The high request rate directly caused the worker process to hit the connection limit, leading to a crash."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely cause is the server reaching its maximum connection limit due to an overwhelming number of requests."
