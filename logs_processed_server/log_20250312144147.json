{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive open connections exceeding the maximum limit (1024).",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic leading to increased requests",
            "Connection leaks or improper connection handling",
            "Misconfiguration of maximum connection limits",
            "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The server received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to 503 errors and a worker process restart.",
            "Impact": "Service unavailability and potential data loss due to dropped connections.",
            "Correlations": "Linked to the high request rate and connection overload causing the worker process to restart."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is the excessive number of open connections overwhelming the server."
