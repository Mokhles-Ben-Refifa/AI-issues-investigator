{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive open connections exceeding the maximum limit (1024) caused the worker process to fail and the web server to crash.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic spike leading to excessive connections.",
            "Misconfiguration of Nginx connection limits.",
            "Potential DDoS attack overwhelming the server."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The server received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to a 503 error and worker process restart.",
            "Impact": "Users experienced service unavailability (503 errors), and the server required a restart.",
            "Correlations": "The high request rate directly correlated with exceeding the connection limit, causing the crash."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The primary cause is the surge in connections beyond the configured limit, overwhelming the server's capacity."
