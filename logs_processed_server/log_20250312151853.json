{
    "Root Cause": "Exceeded maximum open connections (1024) leading to worker process crash.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic or request spike overwhelming server capacity.",
            "Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.",
            "Misconfiguration of Nginx connection limits.",
            "Application or service holding onto connections longer than necessary."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Nginx reported receiving 1200 requests in 10 seconds, followed by warnings of too many open connections, and ultimately a worker process crash.",
            "Impact": "Service became unavailable (503 errors), leading to potential loss of users and revenue.",
            "Correlations": "The high request rate directly correlates with the server reaching its connection limit, causing the worker process to restart and the service to crash."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is that the server received more simultaneous connections than it was configured to handle, overwhelming the worker process and causing a crash."
