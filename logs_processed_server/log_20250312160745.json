        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Nginx worker process reached connection limit, leading to a restart.",
            "Impact": "Service unavailable (503 errors), degraded user experience.",
            "Correlations": "High request rate (1200 in 10 seconds) contributed to overload."
