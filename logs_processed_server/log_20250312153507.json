{
    "Root Cause": "Excessive open connections exceeding the maximum limit of 1024.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic leading to excessive concurrent connections.",
            "Insufficient max connections configuration.",
            "Abnormal client behavior opening too many connections."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The server received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to a 503 error and worker restart.",
            "Impact": "Users experienced service unavailability, and server performance degraded.",
            "Correlations": "High request rate caused connection overflow, leading to worker restart and potential server crash."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely cause is the server hitting its max connection limit due to high traffic."
