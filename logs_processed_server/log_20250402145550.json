{
    "Cluster ID": 0,
    "Root Cause": "Server overload due to high CPU usage and excessive connections",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-01-01 10:00:00] ERROR - 500 Internal Server Error on /api/data",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic overwhelming server capacity",
            "Misconfiguration of server resources",
            "Inefficient application handling of requests"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Multiple errors indicate server overload, including high CPU usage (95%) and maximum connection limits being exceeded.",
            "Impact": "Users experience service unavailability due to 500 and 502 errors, indicating internal server issues.",
            "Correlations": "The 500 error, 502 Bad Gateway, and connection limits being reached all point to server overload."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The combination of high CPU usage and hitting connection limits strongly suggests the server is overwhelmed, likely due to insufficient resources or improper configuration."
