{
    "Root Cause": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024) due to excessive open connections.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High request rate overwhelming server capacity.",
            "Connection limit (1024) set too low for current traffic.",
            "Excessive open connections due to client behavior or misconfiguration."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The server received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to 503 errors and worker process restarts.",
            "Impact": "Users experience 503 Service Unavailable errors, and the server crashes, affecting availability.",
            "Correlations": "The high request rate correlates with exceeding connection limits, causing worker restarts and server crashes."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The server's connection limit is insufficient for the current traffic, causing worker processes to overload and crash."
    }
