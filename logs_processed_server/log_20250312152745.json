{
    "Root Cause": "Exceeded maximum connections (1024) due to high request volume.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic overwhelming the server",
            "Incorrect connection limit configuration",
            "Inadequate connection recycling",
            "Insufficient load balancing"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The server received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to too many open connections and a worker process restart, eventually causing a web server crash.",
            "Impact": "Users experienced 503 Service Unavailable errors, and the web server became unavailable, affecting service availability.",
            "Correlations": "The high request rate led to exceeding the connection limit, causing worker restarts and subsequent system crash."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The root cause is the connection limit being too low for the traffic volume, leading to worker process overload and server crash."
    }
