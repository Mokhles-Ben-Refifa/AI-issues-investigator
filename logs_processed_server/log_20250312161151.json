{
    "Root Cause": "Nginx worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024) due to high request volume.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic volume overwhelming server capacity",
            "Misconfiguration of Nginx connection limits",
            "Denial of Service (DoS) attack",
            "Application not releasing connections properly"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Nginx received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to 503 Service Unavailable errors and worker process restarts.",
            "Impact": "Service unavailability, degraded user experience, potential data loss.",
            "Correlations": "High request rate correlated with connection limit exhaustion."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is the high request volume overwhelming Nginx's connection capacity."
