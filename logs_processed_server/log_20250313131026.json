{
    "Root Cause": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024).",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "2025-02-25 16:10:18 ERROR [Nginx] Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic leading to excessive open connections.",
            "Configuration issue with connection limits.",
            "Resource exhaustion (e.g., memory or CPU)."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log shows a rapid increase in requests (1200 in 10 seconds), followed by a warning of too many open connections, and an error when the worker process exceeds the connection limit.",
            "Impact": "The web server becomes unresponsive, leading to 503 Service Unavailable errors and potential downtime.",
            "Correlations": "The high request rate directly correlates with the subsequent connection limit issue, indicating that the server was unable to handle the load within the configured limits."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is that the worker process reached the maximum number of connections (1024), which was triggered by the high request rate, leading to the restart of the worker process."
