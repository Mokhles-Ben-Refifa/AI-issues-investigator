    "Root Cause": "Web server configuration error leading to 500 Internal Server Error",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-28 15:45:01] ERROR - 500 Internal Server Error on /api/data",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Incorrect NGINX configuration",
            "Insufficient worker processes",
            "High server load",
            "Resource limitations (e.g., memory, CPU)",
            "Application-level errors propagating to the server"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The logs indicate a 500 Internal Server Error, which is a generic error response given by web servers when an unexpected condition occurs. This error is often related to server-side issues such as misconfiguration, resource exhaustion, or application-level errors.",
            "Impact": "Users are unable to access the /api/data endpoint, which could lead to failed requests, data retrieval issues, and potentially impacts the overall functionality of the application.",
            "Correlations": "The WARNING log about the worker process exiting unexpectedly and the subsequent restart of the NGINX service suggest that the server was experiencing instability or overload."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is a server configuration issue, possibly related to NGINX settings or resource allocation. The 500 error and worker process exit indicate that the server was unable to handle the request properly, pointing to a server-level problem rather than a database, application, system, or network issue."
