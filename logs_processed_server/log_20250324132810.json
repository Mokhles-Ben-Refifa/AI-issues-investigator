            "File permissions issue"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The server is unable to find the 'config.yaml' file, which is critical for its operation.",
            "Impact": "The server may fail to start or function correctly without the configuration file.",
            "Correlations": "This issue may be related to deployment issues or misconfigurations."
        },
