{
    "Root Cause": "Exceeded maximum connections per worker process (1024).",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic leading to excessive connections.",
            "Insufficient worker processes to handle the load.",
            "Incorrect configuration of maximum connections per worker."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The log shows a spike in requests (1200 in 10 seconds) leading to connection limits being reached, causing worker restarts and server crashes.",
            "Impact": "Users experience 503 Service Unavailable errors, and the web server becomes unstable.",
            "Correlations": "High request volume correlates with connection limits, leading to worker crashes and server instability."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is the worker process hitting the maximum connection limit due to high traffic, leading to service unavailability and crashes."
