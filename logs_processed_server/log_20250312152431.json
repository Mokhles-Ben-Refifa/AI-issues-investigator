{
    "Root Cause": "Exceeded maximum open connections (1024) due to high request volume.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic spike",
            "Misconfiguration of maximum connections",
            "Connection leakage",
            "Denial of Service (DoS) attack"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The server received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to 503 errors and worker process restarts.",
            "Impact": "Users experienced service unavailability, and the server crashed, requiring a restart.",
            "Correlations": "The high request rate directly caused connection exhaustion, leading to server instability."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely cause is exceeding the connection limit due to a high request volume."
