        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Nginx received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to 503 errors and worker process restarts.",
            "Impact": "Users experience service unavailability, and the server becomes unresponsive.",
            "Correlations": "High request rate correlated with connection limit exhaustion."
        },
