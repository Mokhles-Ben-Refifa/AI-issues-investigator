{
    "Root Cause": "Exceeded maximum connections (1024) due to high request volume.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Sudden traffic spike",
            "Denial of Service (DoS) attack",
            "Misconfiguration of Nginx worker_connections setting"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Nginx received 1200 requests in 10 seconds, leading to 503 errors and worker process restart.",
            "Impact": "Users experienced service unavailability, leading to potential revenue loss and user dissatisfaction.",
            "Correlations": "High request rate correlated with worker process failure and subsequent server crash."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is the excessive number of connections overwhelming the server's capacity."
