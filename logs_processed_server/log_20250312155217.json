{
    "Root Cause": "Exceeded maximum connections (1024) in Nginx worker process.",
    "Log Classification": "Server",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "2025-02-25 16:10:18 ERROR [Nginx] Worker process exceeded maximum connections (1024). Restarting worker...",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "High traffic leading to excessive concurrent connections.",
            "Misconfiguration of Nginx connection limits.",
            "Long-lived connections due to application logic."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "Nginx worker process hit the maximum connection limit of 1024, leading to a restart. Prior logs show a high request rate (1200 requests in 10 seconds) and a 503 Service Unavailable error due to too many open connections.",
            "Impact": "The web server became unavailable, returning 503 errors to clients and requiring a worker process restart, which can lead to dropped requests and degraded user experience.",
            "Correlations": "The high request rate (1200 requests in 10 seconds) directly correlates with the connection limit being reached, indicating that the server was unable to handle the load within the configured limits."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The root cause is the worker process exceeding the maximum connection limit due to high traffic or connection exhaustion, leading to service unavailability and automatic restarts."
