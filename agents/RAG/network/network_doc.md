# üìò Reference Guide - Network Errors & Recommendations

This document provides intelligent agents with the most common network-related issues and their resolution strategies. It is meant to enhance RAG-based diagnostic systems.

## üåê Network Timeout

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-28 10:45:30] ERROR - Request to api.external-service.com timed out after 30s
```

**Likely cause**:

- Destination service is unresponsive  
- Network congestion or unstable connection  
- DNS resolution delay

**Recommendations**:

- Test network latency with `ping` or `traceroute`  
- Increase client timeout settings  
- Retry with exponential backoff  
- Monitor service availability

## üîå Connection Refused

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-29 14:20:55] ERROR - Connection refused to 127.0.0.1:5432
```

**Likely cause**:

- Target service is not running  
- Port not open or listening  
- Firewall rules blocking access

**Recommendations**:

- Verify service status with `systemctl` or `ps`  
- Check port availability with `netstat` or `ss`  
- Ensure proper firewall/NAT rules

## üß≠ DNS Resolution Failure

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-30 09:05:17] ERROR - Failed to resolve host: database.internal
```

**Likely cause**:

- Invalid DNS configuration  
- Internal hostname not registered  
- DNS server unreachable

**Recommendations**:

- Check `/etc/resolv.conf` or DNS client settings  
- Test with `nslookup` or `dig`  
- Configure fallback DNS (e.g., 8.8.8.8)

## üì¥ No Route to Host

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-31 12:11:40] ERROR - No route to host 192.168.1.10
```

**Likely cause**:

- Incorrect routing table or gateway  
- Interface down  
- Host unreachable or blocked

**Recommendations**:

- Use `ip route` to inspect routing  
- Ensure the correct interface is up  
- Use `arp`, `ping`, and `traceroute` to debug path

---

## üì∂ Packet Loss

**Log example**:

```
[2025-01-01 16:33:21] WARNING - Packet loss detected: 25% to service.internal
```

**Likely cause**:

- Network congestion  
- Faulty switch/router or cabling  
- Wireless interference

**Recommendations**:

- Test with `ping -c 100` or `mtr`  
- Check switch/router logs and stats  
- Use wired connections where possible

---

## üîÅ Port Already in Use

**Log example**:

```
[2025-01-02 18:20:01] ERROR - Cannot bind to port 80: Address already in use
```

**Likely cause**:

- Another process is occupying the port  
- Previous process not released the port properly

**Recommendations**:

- Identify process with `lsof -i :80` or `netstat -tulnp`  
- Stop conflicting service or change port  
- Use socket reuse options if appropriate
