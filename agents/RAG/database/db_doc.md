# üìò Reference Guide - Database Errors & Recommendations

This document is intended to help intelligent agents detect and resolve common database-related issues. It supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows for automated diagnostics.

## üß± Connection Timeout

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-17 08:15:45] ERROR - Database connection timeout after 30 seconds
```

**Likely cause**:

- Network issues between app and DB  
- Database under heavy load  
- Incorrect connection settings

**Recommendations**:

- Check network stability and firewall rules  
- Increase connection timeout value if needed  
- Optimize queries to reduce DB load  
- Use connection pooling

## üîë Authentication Failed

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-17 09:20:12] ERROR - FATAL: password authentication failed for user "app_user"
```

**Likely cause**:

- Incorrect username/password  
- Expired or revoked credentials

**Recommendations**:

- Verify credentials and environment variables  
- Rotate passwords and refresh secrets  
- Check DB user permissions and role settings

## üóÉÔ∏è Table or Column Not Found

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-18 13:05:30] ERROR - ERROR: column "user_email" does not exist
```

**Likely cause**:

- Querying a non-existent table or column  
- Schema mismatch between environments

**Recommendations**:

- Review schema definitions and migrations  
- Use introspection tools or ORM to validate schema  
- Sync environments (dev/staging/prod)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deadlocks

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-19 17:44:00] WARNING - Deadlock detected. Retrying transaction.
```

**Likely cause**:

- Concurrent access to shared resources in conflicting order  
- Long-running transactions

**Recommendations**:

- Keep transactions short and atomic  
- Avoid locking entire tables  
- Use retries with exponential backoff  
- Analyze deadlock graphs if supported by DB

---

## üßÆ High Query Latency

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-20 11:30:12] WARNING - Query took 4500ms to execute
```

**Likely cause**:

- Missing indexes  
- Inefficient joins or filters  
- Too much data processed

**Recommendations**:

- Add indexes on filter and join columns  
- Use `EXPLAIN` or query analyzer to detect bottlenecks  
- Break down complex queries or paginate results

---

## üß® Data Corruption

**Log example**:

```
[2024-12-21 07:50:10] ERROR - Data format error: Unexpected NULL in non-nullable column
```

**Likely cause**:

- Application inserted invalid data  
- Inconsistent or partial writes

**Recommendations**:

- Add constraints and validations on input  
- Use transactions to ensure atomic writes  
- Set up DB backups and integrity checks
