{
    "Cluster ID": 1,
    "Root Cause": "High CPU usage and resource constraints leading to application crash",
    "Log Classification": "Application",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 09:13:00] ERROR - CPU usage exceeded 95% for 2 minutes",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Memory leaks",
            "Inefficient resource utilization",
            "Overloaded application logic"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The logs show sustained high CPU usage followed by an application crash due to a null pointer exception.",
            "Impact": "This would result in downtime and potential data loss if not properly handled.",
            "Correlations": "The crash might be linked to the high CPU usage and subsequent resource constraints."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most probable root cause is high CPU usage and resource constraints leading to an application crash."
    }
