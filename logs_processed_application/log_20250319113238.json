    "Root Cause": "Missing configuration file 'config.yaml'",
    "Log Classification": "Application",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "FileNotFoundError: Missing 'config.yaml'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "The 'config.yaml' file is missing from the expected directory.",
            "Incorrect file path configuration.",
            "File permissions preventing access to 'config.yaml'."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The application attempted to access 'config.yaml' but failed, indicating the file is either missing or inaccessible.",
            "Impact": "The application may fail to start or function correctly, leading to errors and potential crashes.",
            "Correlations": "This issue could be linked to the subsequent 500 Internal Server Error as the server might be unable to handle requests without proper configuration."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is that the 'config.yaml' file is missing or inaccessible, causing the application to fail."
