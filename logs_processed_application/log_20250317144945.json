    "Root Cause": "Missing configuration file causing application errors",
    "Log Classification": "Application",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "FileNotFoundError: Missing 'config.yaml'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "The 'config.yaml' file was not properly deployed",
            "Incorrect file permissions preventing access",
            "The file path is misconfigured in the application"
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The application encountered a 'FileNotFoundError' for 'config.yaml' during execution, which is a critical configuration file.",
            "Impact": "The application cannot start or function properly without this file, leading to unhandled exceptions and potential crashes.",
            "Correlations": "This error is correlated with the subsequent 500 Internal Server Error, as the missing configuration likely caused the server to fail when handling requests."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The missing 'config.yaml' file is the root cause, as it is essential for the application's configuration and proper operation."
