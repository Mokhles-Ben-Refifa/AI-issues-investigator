    "Log Classification": "Application",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "FileNotFoundError: Missing 'config.yaml'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "The 'config.yaml' file is not present in the expected directory.",
            "Incorrect file path configuration in the application.",
            "File permissions preventing access to 'config.yaml'.",
            "The file was accidentally deleted or not deployed."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The error indicates that the application cannot find the required 'config.yaml' file, which is critical for its operation.",
            "Impact": "This issue could cause the application to fail to start or function properly, leading to downtime and potential data loss.",
            "Correlations": "This error is likely linked to application startup processes and configuration loading sequences."
