{
    "Root Cause": "Missing configuration file 'config.yaml'",
    "Log Classification": "Application",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "FileNotFoundError: Missing 'config.yaml'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "The 'config.yaml' file is not present in the expected directory.",
            "The application does not have read permissions for 'config.yaml'.",
            "The file path for 'config.yaml' is incorrect."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The application attempted to access 'config.yaml' but failed, indicating the file is missing or inaccessible.",
            "Impact": "The application cannot start or function properly without the necessary configuration file.",
            "Correlations": "This error may be linked to other startup issues or failed initializations."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most likely root cause is the absence or inaccessibility of the 'config.yaml' file, which is essential for the application's operation."
