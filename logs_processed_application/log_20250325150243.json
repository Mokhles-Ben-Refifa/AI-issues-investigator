    "Cluster ID": 2,
    "Root Cause": "Application crash due to null pointer exception.",
    "Log Classification": "Application",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "[2025-03-24 09:14:15] ERROR - Application crashed due to null pointer exception",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "Poor error handling in application code",
            "Unexpected null values in critical code paths",
            "Inadequate testing for edge cases",
            "Memory management issues"
        ],
