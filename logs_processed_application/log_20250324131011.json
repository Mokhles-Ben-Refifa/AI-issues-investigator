{
    "Root Cause": "Missing 'config.yaml' file causing application failure.",
    "Log Classification": "Application",
    "Explanation": {
        "Log Message": "FileNotFoundError: Missing 'config.yaml'",
        "Possible Causes": [
            "The 'config.yaml' file is missing from the expected directory.",
            "Incorrect file path configuration in the application.",
            "File permissions preventing access to 'config.yaml'."
        ],
        "Detailed Root Cause Analysis": {
            "Observations": "The application attempted to access 'config.yaml' but failed, indicating the file is either missing or inaccessible.",
            "Impact": "The application cannot start or function properly without the configuration file, leading to errors.",
            "Correlations": "This issue may be linked to recent changes in the application setup or deployment."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The absence of 'config.yaml' is the primary cause, as the application cannot proceed without it."
